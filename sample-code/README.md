# Raspberry Pi Sample Code

This folder contains example Python code to use the Pi Camera and General Purpose Input and Output (GPIO) pins. To use the code samples:
1. Download the code samples onto your Raspberry Pi.
1. Follow the wiring diagrams in the [schematics folder](./schematics).
1. Download code libraries using pip. For example:
``` sudo pip install gpiozero ```
1. Open the code sample in your preferred Python editor 
1. Make any required updates as indicated in the code sample comments.
1. Run the program!
